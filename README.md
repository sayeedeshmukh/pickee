# Orica â€“ Smarter Decisions, Simplified

Orica is a full-stack MERN web app that helps users make thoughtful decisions between two options by comparing AI-generated and user-defined pros and cons. It analyzes user mindset and emotional/practical leaning to offer smart, context-aware recommendations.

## Features

- Compares two options using detailed **pros and cons**
- **AI-generated suggestions** using Hugging Face models
- Analyze user **mindset and decision style** (emotional vs practical)
- Visual summaries and final **recommendations**
- Users can also input and rate their own pros/cons
- Built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

---

## How It Works

1. **User inputs two options** to compare.
2. Orica generates **AI-based pros/cons** using Gemini models
3. User can **rate or add** their own points.
4. A **mindset form** helps assess emotional/practical lean.
5. Final recommendation is made using smart AI.
